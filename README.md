## Problem 40 - Champernowne's Constant

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

    0.123456789101112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part is 1.

If $d_n$ represents the n<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

$$d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}$$
